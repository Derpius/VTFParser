# VTFParser
Simple and modern library for parsing the Valve Texture Format.  

This is mainly for use in my other projects like VisTrace, and will be acompanied by a similar BSP parser in the future.  

Provides complete abstraction from the VTF file format for reading high res texture data, with the simplest usage only needing to construct the class, check it's valid, and call `GetPixel` with the coords and mip level.  
*Documentation coming soon*

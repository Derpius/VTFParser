# VTFParser
Simple and modern library for parsing the Valve Texture Format.  

This is mainly for use in my other projects like VisTrace, and is acompanied by https://github.com/Derpius/BSPParser.  

Provides complete abstraction from the VTF file format for reading high res texture data, with the simplest usage only needing to construct the class, check it's valid, and call `GetPixel` with the coords and mip level.  
*Documentation coming soon*
